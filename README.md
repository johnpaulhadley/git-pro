# Git Pro
A demonstration repository showcasing Git and GitHub workflows, best practices, and version control concepts learned through self-directed study.

## Purpose
This repository was created as part of a lifelong learning project to master Git and GitHub beyond basic commands. It demonstrates practical skills essential for collaborative software development, including branching strategies, conflict resolution, and release management.

### Version Control Workflows
- **Branching Strategy**: Feature branch workflow with `main` as the stable branch
- **Commit Conventions**: Atomic commits following Conventional Commits style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- **Pull Requests**: Merge changes through pull requests for code review simulation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Documented merge conflict resolution process

### Advanced Git Operations
- Rebasing and merge strategies
- Stashing changes for context switching
- Using `git reflog` for recovery
- Release tagging (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
